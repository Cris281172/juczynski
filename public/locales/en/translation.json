    "description": "In December 2020 I started my adventure with the frontend. After about 7 months of hard training I found my first job as Junior Frontend Devloper. After a year of work, the project came to an end and I found a new job where I was able to further develop my skills for 3 months. I am currently looking for a job where I can expand in the world of frontend and also try my hand in the backend."
